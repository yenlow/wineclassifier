# Wine Classifier
Predicts wines one would most likely drink using Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Learning on [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)'s reviews on 130k wines. 
Current dataset is based on a single reviewer (points >= 90 are labeled as "drinkable"). 

Classifier may be extended into a recommender to predict for individual preferences if dataset includes multiple reviewers.

### Builds
Tensorflow 1.9
Keras 2.2.2
